# Design of experiment

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the use of DoE.
The python notebooks are based on the ```doepy``` package and the notebook on logistic regression uses ```sklearn```.

## Quadratic function

Firstly we focus on evaluating the coefficient of a quadratic function. Indeed we rarely consider interactions of variables above second or third order.
The results can be found in the ```quadratic_function.ipynb```, and ```noisy_quadratic_function.ipynb``` that adds a white noise to the evaluation to the quadratic function.

## Design of experiments for hyper-parameter search 

We then try to apply design of experiment to hyperparameter search in the ```logistic_regression.ipynb``` notebook.
